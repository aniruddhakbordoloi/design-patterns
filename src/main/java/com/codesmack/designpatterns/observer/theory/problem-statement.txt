The problem

Create a weather monitoring application which gives the following displays to a user:
1. Current conditions
2. Statistics
3. Forecast
These displays depend on temperature, humidity and pressure which are provided by a third party API (in your case, assume this to be set by the client class). The API has got one class
exposed which holds the information of temp/humid/pressure change. Each time there is a change in any of the params - temperature, humidity or pressure - the display would change and the notifications should be sent out from the exposed API class.

Solutioning

1. Identify who needs to be updated - the displays in this case.
2. Identify who is the updater - the one who gets the information from the client class - your exposed API class in this case.
3. The updater has to publish a change event and all subscribers, who need to be updated have to listen and apply the change.
4. As an advise, the subscriber can listen to events only they are interested in and avoid the publisher from transmitting all data.


Try implementing both ways of observer - the push model with your own designed observer and the pull model using java's built in observable.
